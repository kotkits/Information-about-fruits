        <h1>What to Know about Oranges</h1>
        
        <p id="p1">Oranges are a type of low calorie, highly nutritious citrus fruit. <br>As part of a healthful and varied diet, oranges contribute to strong,<br> clear skin and can help lower a person’s risk of many conditions.</p>
        <br>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
    <p>Oranges are popular due to their natural sweetness, the many different types available, and the diversity of <br>uses. For example, a person can consume them in juices and marmalades, eat them whole, or use zested<br> peel to add a tangy flavor to cakes and desserts.</p>
    <br>
<p>This popular citrus fruit is particularly known for its vitamin C content. However, oranges contain a range of <br>other plant compounds and antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and work against disease.</p>
<br>
<p>In this article, we look at the many health benefits of oranges, their nutritional profile, and how to <br>include more in the diet.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div2">
    <br>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <br>
<p>The nutrients in oranges offer a range of health benefits. The sections below discuss these benefits in <br>more detail.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
    <h3>Cancer</h3>
    <br>
<img src="orange.jfif" alt="orange">
<p>As an excellent sourceof the antioxidant vitamin C, oranges may help combat the formation of <br>free radicals that cause cancer.</p>
<br>
<p>Although an adequate vitamin C intake is necessary and very beneficial, the amount a person<br>would need for the desired therapeutic effect on cancer is more than they could realistically<br>consume.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, one study concluded that medical scientists could harness the power of vitamin<br>C from oranges to inhibit colorectal cancer cells in the future. However, the authors concede<br>that 300 oranges’ worth of vitamin C would be necessary.</p>
<br>
<p>That said, in 2015, a study linked grapefruit and orange juice with a higher risk of skin cancer.<br>Researchers found that people who consumed high amounts of whole grapefruit or orange<br>juice were over a third more likely to develop melanoma than those who consumed low<br>amounts. This may have been due to citrus compounds that exert photocarcinogen properties.</p>
<br>
<p> More research is necessary to confirm the effects of orange consumption on cancer risk.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div2">
    <br>
    <h3>Blood pressure</h3>
    <br>
<p>Oranges contain no sodium, which helps keep a person below their daily limit. On the other<br>hand, a cup of orange juice can boost daily potassium intake by 14%.</p>
<br>
<p>Maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure. However, increasing<br>potassium intake may be just as important for reducing a person’s risk of high blood pressure,<br>as it can help support the relaxation and opening of blood vessels.</p>
<br>
<p>According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), increasing potassium intake can reduce<br>the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
    <h3>Heart health</h3>
    <br>
<p>Oranges are a good source of fiber and potassium, both of which can support heart health.</p>
<br>
<p>According to one 2017 reviewof previous meta-analyses, consuming enough fiber can<br>significantly reduce the risk of heart disease both developing and being fatal. The review links<br>this effect to its ability to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.</p>
<br>
<p>One cup of orange juice can provide 14% of a person’s daily potassium requirement.</p>
<br>
<p>The ODS found that people with higher potassium intakes may have a lower risk of stroke and<br>other cardiovascular diseases. They mainly attribute this to the effects of potassium on blood<br>pressure.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div2">
    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
    <br>
<p>A medium orange weighing 131 grams (g) contributes 3.14 gof fiber, which is nearly 10% of an<br>adult’s daily fiber requirement. Several studies have found that fiber can improve some factors<br> that contribute to diabetes development and progression.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, one 2019 study found that consuming 4 g of a dietary fiber supplement per day<br>did not reduce blood glucose but improved how the body responds to insulin. Low insulin<br>sensitivity can contribute to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<br>
<p>Weight control is also important for reducing the risk of diabetes, as obesity and overweight<br>can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. The body processes fiber more slowly<br>than other nutrients, so it can help a person feel fuller for longer and reduce their urge to eat<br>snacks throughout the day.</p>
<br>
<p>Following a diet that contains a high proportion of fruits and vegetables can support blood<br>sugar control and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and disease progression. That said, a<br>diabetes friendly diet should include healthful foods from a variety of food groups.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
    <h3>Skin</h3>
    <br>
<p>Consuming enough vitamin C can help a person maintain skin health and appearance.</p>
<br>
<p>Vitamin C contributes to collagen production. Collagen supports the skin, promotes wound<br>healing, and improves skin strength.</p>
<br>
<p>The outcome of a 2015 review suggests that dietary vitamin C improved how people<br>perceived their skin health and how healthful it actually was, including appearance, wrinkling,<br>elasticity, and roughness.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <br>
<p>One medium orange weighing 131 g provides:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>61.6 calories</li>
    <li>0.16 g of fat</li>
    <li>237 milligrams of potassium</li>
    <li>15.4 g of carbohydrate</li>
    <li>12.2 g of sugar</li>
    <li>1.23 g of protein</li>
</ul>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
<p>The same orange provides the following percentages of a person’s daily requirement of<br>several essential vitamins and minerals, according to United States Department of Agriculture<br>guidelines:</p>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Nutrient</th>
        <th>Percentage of daily requirement for adults</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Vitamin C</td>
        <td>92.93% for females and 77.44% for males</td>

    <br>
    <p>Oranges also contain choline and zeaxanthin.</p>
    <br>
<p>Choline is an important nutrient in oranges that helps with sleep, muscle movement, learning,<br>and memory. Choline also aids the transmission of nerve impulses, assists in the absorption of<br>fat, and reduces chronic inflammation.</p>
<br>
<p>Zeaxanthin is a type of carotenoid antioxidant that can reduce inflammation. According to a<br>2019 review, it can positively benefit heart, liver, skin, and eye health.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div1">
    <br>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It is best to pick oranges at the peak of their ripeness. Unlike some other fruits, they do not<br>ripen or improve in quality after picking. People should store oranges at room temperature and<br>away from direct sunlight.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It can be hard to find ripe fruits and vegetables in the winter. However, this is the perfect time<br>to buy citrus fruits. Winter is the peak season for oranges and other citruses.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are several different types of orange available, including:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>navel</li>
    <li>mandarin</li>
    <li>Cara Cara</li>
    <li>blood oranges</li>
    <li>Valencia</li>
    <li>Seville</li>
    <li>jaffa</li>
</ul>
<br>
</div>
<div class="div2">
    <br>
<p>Here are some tips for using orange in the diet:</p>
<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a bowl on the kitchen table or counter stocked with fresh fruit from the season. Seeing fruits<br>readily available will likely influence people to choose them as a snack, rather than raiding the<br>cupboards for a less healthful option.</li>
        <br>
    <li>Make a fruit salad using strawberries, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and grapes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add some orange slices to a salad at lunch or dinner. Complement the oranges with walnuts or<br>pecans, a crumbled cheese, and a light balsamic or citrus vinaigrette dressing.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Make homemade juice. Freshly squeezed orange juice can be a flavorful, refreshing, and nutritious<br>addition to a person’s morning routine. Squeezing orange juice at home will mean that there are no<br>added preservatives or sweeteners.</li>
        <br>
</ul>
<br>

    <br>
    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <br>
<p>People with gastroesophageal reflux disease may experience an increase in symptoms such as heartburn<br>and regurgitation when consuming citrus fruits. This is due to their high acid content.</p>
<br>
<p>A person can achieve and maintain good health by eating a varied diet that contains many different types<br>and groups of food.</p>
